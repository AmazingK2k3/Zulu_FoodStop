# Zulu_University_FoodStop
 Zulu is a concept team project that is aimed to be a food delivery and ordering app for university students both in a hostel and on campus. It is aimed at easy access for students to order food directly from vendors. This project was created to learn built using Dart and Flutter. This application allows users to browse through a variety of food items, add them to their cart, and place orders with ease. It is integrated with Firestore for seamless data management and ensures a smooth user experience with its modern design and functionality. The project is still under work (if I get going on this again) but I hope to build the UI closer to the design files [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/RSmo36aFcjIFVqv0HD67pB/Zulu?t=IxbnRuzymWl8QjNq-1)
